This web application, developed as a class project, is a work in progress for a bakery management system. It is built using Ruby on Rails, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The project includes a `docs` directory that contains the specifications and entity relationship diagrams. Current development efforts are focused on enhancing the data models located in the `app` folder, along with their corresponding tests in the `tests` folder.
